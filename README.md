# intro-to-frontend-development
This repo is based on a series of project I am working on to familiarise myself with Javascript. Some of them are based on tasks assigned on mentor-dev, a javascript peer-to-peer program.

If you come across errors or would like to provide headsup on how I can better enhance my learning process, please feel free to start a pull request with your modification.
