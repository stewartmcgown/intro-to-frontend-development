 I built a form with html5 to get to know you better ðŸ˜„.
      <p> It's a simple form. Here is my recommended way of filling it in 3 steps : </p>
      <ol> 
      <li> 
        Read these steps really fast.
        </li>
        <li> Realize that you can ignore them.</li>
        <li> Continue to fill the form however you like.</li>
      </ol>
        </main>
      <form>
